INTERVIEWER_GENERIC_ACKNOWLEDGED	I see.
PROLOGUE_00	Mmm...| Damn, my head hurts. Where am I?| ...Looks like a holding cell. How did I end up here?| I've gotta think...| Okay. Last I recall, Willow Thorn and I were coming in to work at the Grim Sages' Office of Geomancy as usual, and our true identities and purpose was still unknown... I think.| We were getting closer to our objective, but still a couple of weeks away at least from getting access to the Ever-Stone Matrix.| Our first hour went fine... and so did the next few. I remember us grabbing lunch...
PROLOGUE_01	Right. It was when we came back from lunch that things went wrong. Willow and I came back to the office, only to meet Jack Dexter, of all people. He recognized me even through my perception charm. I knew he could, but I was truly hoping he'd just leave Willow and I be. Since we were completely surrounded half an hour later, I'm going to assume he decided to rat us out.
PROLOGUE_01_X	Bastard.
PROLOGUE_02	They shouted at us to disarm; to put our wands down and submit to capture. Willow was so nervous, and was about to try to fight her way out of an impossible situation. I only just barely got her to calm down and surrender. I think they knocked me out quickly after my wand was separated from me. I'm bound and gagged now; probably to prevent me from weaving any spells through vocalization. That's smart; I absolutely would be charming my way out of here otherwise.
PROLOGUE_03	I wonder if they know why we're here? Jack Dexter may have recognized me, but last we saw each other was quite a while ago; that was before I joined the Mages of Brittle Hollow. If I'm lucky, they'll give away how much or how little they know about my purpose here when they come to ask me questions. I imagine that will be any minute now, because I'm sure they probably have someone watching me to see when I wake up.
PROLOGUE_04	Ah, sure enough, here comes someone in to my little holding cell to speak to me.
INTERVIEWER_A_00	Well well well... Adelaide Quelby. Your reputation is known to us. We know full well that you're not the type to work with us, and I think the fact that you told us you were someone else entirely when you and Willow Thorn came to join us makes that quite clear. Hmm, is that gag a little too tight? Would you like me to loosen it? ...Hahaha, not a chance, my dear. No, as I said: your reputation is known to us. We'll not be granting you the ability to speak or write.
INTERVIEWER_A_01	Sorry to disappoint you. I'm sure you were counting on using elder languages or true names to escape with or without your focusing wand. And we won't be offering you any thing you could use to draw sigils or glyphs either. Nor will you be making any kinetoglyphs with your hands, which I am sure you are finding to be uncomfortably bound together. No rabbits up your sleeves this time, my dear. But it is a shame that you won't easily be able to answer us like this.
INTERVIEWER_A_02	In fact, that unfortunately only leaves us to getting answers out of you through less efficient forms of communication. But that will have to do for now, at least until we're able to prepare an environment that will be properly protected from any escape attempts you might try, and arrange for an interrogator more suited to your level of abilities to meet you. Until then, I implore you to work with us. My superiors are eager to know all about what you're here for, so much so that I am sure they might be willing to make you offers to accommodate you if you cooperate.
INTERVIEWER_A_03	First things first, for the record, let's have you confirm for me that you are indeed Adelaide Quelby. Tap your hands on the back of that metal chair you're sitting in once for 'yes', and twice for 'no, I'm going to be difficult'.
INTERVIEWER_A_03_NULL_RESPONSE	Come on, we didn't bind you that tightly. Tap once to confirm you are indeed Adelaide Quelby.
INTERVIEWER_A_03_NULL_RESPONSE_TWICE	Tap your chair, Adelaide Quelby. Confirm your identity, and confirm that you are willing to cooperate, or we may have to consider escalation in our next meeting.
INTERVIEWER_A_03_NULL_RESPONSE_THRICE	So be it, Adelaide. If you don't mind, I'm going to continue on and ask the questions I have been told to ask, whether you intend to answer them or not. I encourage you not continue to be so stubborn, as I swear to you that you will be made to regret it, my dear.
INTERVIEWER_A_03_AFFIRMATIVE	Thank you. I know it seems like a strange little formality, but the scribes are very insistent we ask and confirm questions we already know answers to. They do their jobs very well though, so I think it's fair to accommodate the eccentricities they ask of us so everyone's job is a little easier. Thank you, again, for accommodating this eccentricity yourself. As you make my job easier, I'll try to make your stay here easier. Let's continue.
INTERVIEWER_A_03_NEGATIVE	You know, I am generally rather entertained by those possessing a sharp, sarcastic wit. Generally. Unfortunately, I'm not in the mood for such antics. I'm going to interpret your 'no' as a 'yes' any way, because we truly already know who you are - asking you to confirm your name is simply a formality.
INTERVIEWER_A_03_TOO_MANY_TAPS	That was more than two. I'm going to assume that many taps was your way of trying to communicate expletives in my direction. I apologize if I am mistaken, but I'm quite certain that I am not, and I thus advise you to cut that out. I won't play to such childish and feeble attempts at communication, and when I report our interview here and in future sessions to my superiors, I will be sure to tell them how uncooperative you are being if you continue in this manner.
INTERVIEWER_A_04	Second question - this one is about Willow Thorn.
THOUGHTS_A_04_00	Willow's just a rookie. She's pretty fresh out of school, and has only been casting as an adult for maybe two or three years. It was a mistake for them insist I let her join me for this infiltration mission. She's brilliant, sure, and has a lot of potential, but intrigue makes her nervous. Although she's kept it well from everyone else, I've had to help her steel her nerves back at the hotel many times at the end of a long day where she thought for certain that someone had found us out.
INTERVIEWER_A_05	Please confirm that Willow Thorn is the name of your accomplice. Tap once for 'yes', twice for 'no'.
INTERVIEWER_A_05_NULL_RESPONSE	Adelaide, I remind you again that cooperation comes highly recommended. Once for 'yes', twice for 'no'.
INTERVIEWER_A_05_NULL_RESPONSE_TWICE	Confirm that Willow Thorn is the name of your accomplice, Adelaide. Last time I ask.
INTERVIEWER_A_05_NULL_RESPONSE_THRICE_FIRST_NULL_RESPONSE	Fine. I'm sure we'll find out what her name is soon enough from her or another source. All you've accomplished is to hurt your chances of receiving a more... favourable treatment.
INTERVIEWER_A_05_NULL_RESPONSE_THRICE_STOIC	This interview is going to be very dull if you never answer any questions at all, Adelaide.
INTERVIEWER_A_05_AFFIRMATIVE	Thank you. We will have to confirm that ourselves still, as we don't truly recognize her, of course. But barring any other source on her name, we'll go with this. I'm sure her name doesn't truly matter; it would only be a matter of convenience for all really if we know what she goes by.
INTERVIEWER_A_05_NEGATIVE	So that was a pseudonym as well? Truly, we don't recognize her at all, and she's so young I myself was just as soon to assume she's still essentially a no-body. Pseudonyms are standard procedure any way, of course but... I almost wonder if the fact that she was using a pseudonym means she's actually someone of importance after all... mmm, that is, of course... assuming you aren't lying. We'll just have to be sure to get some second opinions on your answer.
INTERVIEWER_A_06	Third question, this one is a bit of a multi-parter. Who is Willow Thorn to you?
THOUGHTS_A_06_00	I haven't known Willow outside of joining up with the Mages of Brittle Hollow. They recruited us both around the same time - different people recruited us though, under different circumstances, so we only met about a year ago, and it was a couple months after that that they asked me if I would go undercover at the Grim Sages' Office of Geomancy, working alongside a partner, then introduced me to Willow as my partner for the operation.
INTERVIEWER_A_07_A	Is Willow Thorn family to you? Once for yes, twice for no. I do encourage being honest here, as my superiors might be kinder in how we treat you two.
THOUGHTS_A_07_00	That's a load of crap.
INTERVIEWER_A_07_ANY_AFFIRMATIVE_SUPPLEMENTAL	A favour for me will result in a favour for you and her, you see. Just make sure you keep answering, and truthfully, and I'll try to ensure she's happy and treated nicely, perhaps even that they put a nice soft cushion in her chair to sit on instead of leaving her to sit on the hard surface you and she are sitting on now. Otherwise... there will be no such benefits.
INTERVIEWER_A_07_A_FAMILY_AFFIRMATIVE	Interesting.
INTERVIEWER_A_07_A_FAMILY_FOLLOWUP	Close family or distant family? Tap once for close, twice for distant.
INTERVIEWER_A_07_A_FAMILY_FOLLOWUP_AFFIRMATIVE_ANY_ANSWER	Noted, thank you. If you cooperate with me nicely, I might go try to see to it that they treat her nicely.
INTERVIEWER_A_07_A_FAMILY_FOLLOWUP_AFFIRMATIVE_NO_ANSWER	Fair enough, I suppose this question was rather personal to begin with.
INTERVIEWER_A_07_B	Is she perhaps your lover?
INTERVIEWER_A_07_B_LOVER_AFFIRMATIVE	She is? Hmmm. I mean, you are both certainly adults, but isn't she a little young for you, regardless? Sorry, I suppose that's none of my business is it? Listen, if you cooperate with me nicely, I might go try to see to it that they treat her nicely.
INTERVIEWER_A_07_C	Then perhaps she's a family friend?
INTERVIEWER_A_07_C_FAMILY_FRIEND_AFFIRMATIVE	Noted, thank you. If you cooperate with me nicely, I might go try to see to it that they treat her nicely.
INTERVIEWER_A_07_D	Is she more or less a stranger to you then? Remember, tap once for yes, twice for no.
INTERVIEWER_A_07_D_STRANGER_AFFIRMATIVE	I see. Noted, thank you.
INTERVIEWER_A_07_E	Nothing to tell me about you and her then? Fine. Your lack of cooperation on this part is noted.
INTERVIEWER_A_07_F_STOIC	Since you've not tapped even once so far, I'm almost tempted to ask if you even intend to answer any of these questions at all, but I'm not about to give you the opportunity to be smug and satisfied with ignoring such a hypothetical question. No, I think instead I'll keep asking, and we can both suffer through this together.
INTERVIEWER_A_08	Next question is about who you're working for.
THOUGHTS_A_08_00	Ah, so they don't know we're working for the Mages of Brittle Hollow? Fantastic. That means they may not know any thing at all about why we're here. Me showing up undercover without them having any idea who I'm working for probably has this bastard's superiors scared stiff. They're not going to lay a finger on me or Willow Thorn at all until one of us either gives them an answer or they figure it out themselves, and our disappearance will be noted and a rescue team sent to get us out of here before they could possibly figure us out on their own!
THOUGHTS_A_08_01	As long as we keep the truth, or at least enough of it, from these guys, then we'll be saved. But it will be very important that neither I - nor Willow Thorn - slip up. If the Grim Sages learn too much, they'll be able to cause problems - problems big enough that the Mages of Brittle Hollow won't be able to send a rescue at all.
INTERVIEWER_A_09_A	Pay attention. I'm going to give you multiple choices. Tap once if you're with the Sorceror's Covenant of Protectors, twice if you're with the Mages of Brittle Hollow, thrice if you're with Witches of the Corsair Coast, four times if you're with a different group than those three.
INTERVIEWER_A_09_A_ALPHA_AFFIRMATIVE	...I see.
INTERVIEWER_A_09_A_CANONICAL_AFFIRMATIVE	Well well well... how interesting! Excuse me, I'll need to tell me superiors right away. [GameOverFlag]
INTERVIEWER_A_09_A_BRAVO_AFFIRMATIVE	...Interesting.
INTERVIEWER_A_09_A_SILENT	I'll ask again. Pay attention. I'm going to give you multiple choices. Tap once if you're with the Sorceror's Covenant of Protectors, twice if you're with the Mages of Brittle Hollow, thrice if you're with the Witches of the Corsair Coast, four times if you're with a different group than those three.
INTERVIEWER_A_09_A_STILL_SILENT	I'll just assume you meant to tap four times.
INTERVIEWER_A_09_A_OTHER	Another group? Very well:
INTERVIEWER_A_09_B	Tap once if you're with the Sacred Enchanters of Xerxes, twice if you're with the Order of Sigma, thrice if you're with the Huntresses of Mysterium, four times if you're with a different group.
INTERVIEWER_A_09_B_CHARLIE_AFFIRMATIVE	I'm not surprised. Personally, I knew we couldn't trust your group.
INTERVIEWER_A_09_B_DELTA_AFFIRMATIVE	This was a bold move, coming from your group. Thank you for your honesty. I'll put in a very good word for you, since your own superiors will surely be very unhappy with the inevitable retribution we send them.
INTERVIEWER_A_09_B_ECHO_AFFIRMATIVE	Really? I suppose our brief cooperation was truly not meant to last. A pity.
INTERVIEWER_A_09_B_SILENT	...None of those, perhaps?
INTERVIEWER_A_09_B_OTHER	None of them?
INTERVIEWER_A_09_C	Tap once if you're with the Magisters of Astra, twice if you're with Captain Quirk, thrice if you're just wasting my time.
INTERVIEWER_A_09_C_FOXTROT_AFFIRMATIVE	Ah. I didn't actually expect you might be an agent with the Magisters of Astra. Thank you for your cooperation, and... I suppose apologies are in order for getting sarcastic with you. I was starting to think you were just trying to waste my time.
INTERVIEWER_A_09_C_GOLF_AFFIRMATIVE	Very funny. I hope you're enjoying your little joke, because failure to cooperate, or to give us honest answers, will only result in hardship for you and Willow. We will not hesitate to take out our... frustrations on her, if you don't tell us what we want to know.
INTERVIEWER_A_09_C_OTHER	Very funny. I hope you're enjoying your little joke, because failure to cooperate, or to give us honest answers, will only result in hardship for you and Willow. We will not hesitate to take out our... frustrations on her, if you don't tell us what we want to know.
INTERVIEWER_A_09_C_SILENT	I hope you understand, receiving an answer to that question was very important to us. I wanted to give you a chance to tell us who you're working for before we would have to ask Willow, but since you've chosen not to work with us, we'll just have to ask her. I can not gaurantee we will ask her as nicely as we tried to ask you.
INTERVIEWER_A_09_C_STOIC	Nothing. I suppose you think you're very brave, perhaps even proud of yourself. Not once during this whole interview did you tap or make any sound at all. No response. Perhaps you picture yourself some kind of action hero? Well in real life, no one ever walks away feeling like an action hero from any thing. Want to know why? Because they always realize that trying to act like their heroes gets other people hurt. People like Willow. We tried to ask you nicely. You decided to wear out our patience. Now there's none left for poor Willow. We will not be asking her nicely.
INTERVIEWER_A_10_SOMETIMES_ANSWERED	Well, you may not have answered everything but, thank you for the cooperation you did give. Ordinarily, we might punish you for having failed to answer any questions at all, but just for you, I'll see to it that you are instead rewarded for what you did answer. I'll do this for you, because I want you to see that we're really just trying to work towards a goal that's mutually beneficial for us both in the end.
INTERVIEWER_A_10_ALWAYS_ANSWERED	Thank you, you've been most cooperative. I'll let my superiors know how forthcoming you have been. We'll still need to confirm these questions, and ask them of Willow as well, but I'll be sure to see to it that you and she are rewarded for your helpfulness this interview.
SPACER_A_0	=====
INTERLUDE_A_00	Later that night, you faintly hear some tapping. You try to listen carefully, to try to figure out what it is or where it might be coming from. You quickly decide that the pattern doesn't sound like it's likely automatic; it just doesn't sound cyclical enough. It definitely sounds like some one tapping, and it's not coming from outside your room. No, instead it almost sounds like its echoing from one or more rooms away - perhaps you're hearing it through ventilation ducts? It doesn't sound like someone mindlessly tapping as a sort of tic either; the pattern isn't consistent enough. It's... a message. Prisoner's tap code perhaps?
INTERLUDE_A_01	The pattern should be about to repeat, you can try to decipher it. Here goes...\nA. D. E. L. A. I. D. E.
INTERLUDE_A_01_X	Perhaps Willow Thorn is tapping her chair in her room, and desperately hoping you can hear her? You could answer her by tapping 'Y' - that'll be short for 'yes'.
INTERLUDE_A_01_EXPECTED	Y
INTERLUDE_A_01_FUDGED	Wrong letter. Erm, let's try that again. Hopefully she doesn't get confused by that fudge.
INTERLUDE_A_02	You answered, but you hear your name tapped out again. Maybe she just wants to make sure she wasn't imagining your response.
INTERLUDE_A_02_EXPECTED	Y
INTERLUDE_A_02_FUDGED	Shoot. Well... she might not know what that's about, but hopefully that was enough to let her know you're answering.
INTERLUDE_A_03	The pattern is different this time. It reads...\nS... C... A... R... E... D.
INTERLUDE_A_03_X	Scared. Poor Willow Thorn. They never should have even asked you to take her with you on this mission; you shouldn't have eventually relented. She shouldn't be in this situation. There's not much you can or should tell her though, unfortunately. There's no telling if any one else can hear you two tapping to each other, and if they're perhaps eagering listening to this conversation to see if they can decipher any secrets.
INTERLUDE_A_04	Tapping out 'BX' should be enough to tell her to 'Be Quiet'. That's the most important thing - now and in the interviews. That definitely needs to be the first thing to say.
INTERLUDE_A_04_EXPECTED	BX
INTERLUDE_A_04_EXPECTED_ALTERNATE	BQ
INTERLUDE_A_04_FUDGED	Crap, that's not it. She's going to be totally confused now. [GameOverFlag]
INTERLUDE_A_04_FUDGED_BQ	Close enough.
INTERLUDE_A_05	She's tapping back. O... K. That's it. Good, sounds like she understood. Let's tap something else to her, to try to reassure her. Maybe... 'WE R OK'.
INTERLUDE_A_05_EXPECTED	WEROK
INTERLUDE_A_05_FUDGED	Crap, that's not it. She's going to be totally confused now. [GameOverFlag]
INTERLUDE_A_06	No response. Let's just tap 'BX' once more, make sure she understands how important that is. We'll call it a night. That's all that needs to be said, any way. One can only hope our little rookie stays strong.
INTERLUDE_A_06_EXPECTED	BX
INTERLUDE_A_06_EXPECTED_ALTERNATE	BQ
INTERLUDE_A_06_FUDGED	Crap, that's not it. She's going to be totally confused now. [GameOverFlag]
INTERLUDE_A_06_FUDGED_BQ	Close enough.
INTERLUDE_A_07	She's tapping back. G... N. That's it. Must mean, 'good night'. Good night, Willow Thorn.
SPACER_A_1	=====
INTERVIEWER_Z_00	We know you've been communicating with Willow Thorn at night. We heard you two tapping away, and we know you were telling her to keep quiet. We had hoped you would cooperate with us, but it's quite clear that you have no intention of doing so. Tell me, do you not care what may happen to you? I'm asking rhetorically, so I'm not going to wait for an answer. Do you care what happens to Willow Thorn? For your sake, I hope you don't, because if you do, what we're going to have to do next will hurt you - but not quite like it's going to hurt her. I have to go conduct a special interview with her now, using more forceful methods. Excuse me.
THOUGHTS_Z_00_A	He left. You try to listen carefully. Maybe through the ventilation you can try to hear something? You listen very carefully for many, many minutes. Eventually you hear a loud slamming sound - perhaps a door being opened dramatically, perhaps on purpose, perhaps to make a point, on the assumption you could hear it given the tapping you've been doing with Willow Thorn. You continue to listen carefully, but it's only a few seconds before the next sound you can hear - Willow Thorn's voice shouting, 'Please! Don't!' Then there's a loud sound, followed by a short scream, almost certainly from Willow Thorn. 'No!' you hear, then the sound of a door slamming.
THOUGHTS_Z_00_B	Hours pass, and you've heard nothing since through the ventilation. You suspect they've taken her to another room, and that she may have been hurt in the process of being relocated to that room to perhaps make a point to her about their precious cooperation. This is not good. You don't discount the possibility that they've been quite serious, and are perhaps resorting to painful interrogation methods with her to try to get information out of her. She's new to this and it's so painfully obvious that she's the obvious choice for them to try this on first.
THOUGHTS_Z_00_C	You hope she's alright, but hope is all you can do for now.
THOUGHTS_Z_00_D	Eventually, the silence is interrupted by the sound of the door to your holding cell opening, and your captor interviewer returning.
INTERVIEWER_Z_01	Would you like to know how Willow Thorn did in her latest interview? I'm being rhetorical again, don't bother answering. Just look here... see this spot on my jacket? That's not my blood. Don't worry, she eventually figured out what was in her best interest. We know what we want to know, all thanks to her. But my superiors want to give you one last chance to realize what's in your best interest.
INTERVIEWER_Z_02	We won't be forceful with you like we just were with her, no. Again, you're far too dangerous. We wouldn't discount the possibility you'd somehow use a bleeding wound to paint a sigil in your blood and escape with that. Luckily for you, your skill set is still of interest to my superiors, and luckily for you, you have a known reputation of being something of a mercenary in the world of magic. Whatever you're being paid, we're willing to double it, as a starting offer. I'll ask you some questions, some you might recognize, and if you answer them all correctly, then we'll consider that as you being willing to join us in our employment.
INTERVIEWER_Z_03	To further entice you not to betray us once employed, and to encourage you to seriously consider employment with us, we will be notifying your organization regardless of what you answer me here that you and Willow Thorn were both fully forthcoming will all information you had on them, and see to it that your reputation is ruined with them and any other organizations you might ever align yourself with. Outside of us, your career opportunities as a magical mercenary will be over. Your choice here will be whether you wish to have a fruitful career with us, or whether you wish to be unceremoniously killed at the nearest opportunity and disgracefully left unburied somewhere.
INTERVIEWER_Z_04	As time is precious, I'll just start asking now. Tap once if you're with the Sorceror's Covenant of Protectors, twice if you're with the Mages of Brittle Hollow.
INTERVIEWER_Z_04_SILENCE	Tap once if you're with the Sorceror's Covenant of Protectors, twice if you're with the Mages of Brittle Hollow.
INTERVIEWER_Z_05	Tap once if you're been conspiring with Jack Dexter, twice if you're lying.
INTERVIEWER_Z_06	Tap once if you're attempting to seek access to the Ever-Stone Matrix, twice if you're lying.
INTERVIEWER_Z_07	Tap once if you're expecting a rescue team to come get you, twice if you're not.
INTERVIEWER_Z_08	That is all. Good luck Adelaide, you'll need it.
INTERVIEWER_Z_SILENCE	I see. So you've made your choice. I'm done wasting my time here.
THOUGHTS_Z_08_BAD_END_00	I gave him enough of the truth to screw us over with, although there's no way Willow hasn't already done so herself. Really, I was just answering in my best interests, as shot as they are now, if that guy was telling the truth about their intentions to ruin my life. Now I have only to wait and see what remains of my life, and to try to take solace in the massive pay raise they promised, and better make good on.
THOUGHTS_Z_08_BAD_END_01	After a day of waiting, I noted that if any one was coming to rescue us, they would have done so by now. Not that I was expecting it any more, any way.
THOUGHTS_Z_08_BAD_END_02	After two days of waiting, I realized I wasn't going to get that pay raise when some one stepped in to my little holding cell, only to present me with the opportunity to stare down the barrel of a gun. Turns out they were only truly willing to pay me with two lumps of lead for my trouble.
THOUGHTS_Z_08_LIE_END_00	I didn't believe them. They were lying to me, I was sure of it. With any luck they were putting on a big show - I sure hope that's the case, any way, for Willow's sake. I didn't think I could just stay silent and live to see the end of that day, however, so I made sure to feed them lies. All that's left now is to wait and see if rescue comes. If not... they'll probably dispose of Willow and I both.
THOUGHTS_Z_08_SILENCE_END_00	I didn't believe them. They were lying to me, I was sure of it. With any luck they were putting on a big show - I sure hope that's the case, any way, for Willow's sake. I sat there silently and refused to confirm any of their questions. They probably had no more clue about us or our purpose here than when they captured us, I'm sure of it, and I'm sure that Willow told them nothing. Their narrowed down questions were surely guesses.
THOUGHTS_Z_08_SILENCE_END_01	Only way to know I'm right though is to sit and wait for rescue to come.
THOUGHTS_Z_08_STOIC_END_00	My captors were desperate fools. I would never answer or entertain any of their questions. Whether rescue awaits me, or only death at the hands of a frustrated Grim Sage, my spirit was untarnished, and unbreakable.
EPILOGUE_RESCUE_00	Luckily, a day later, rescue came. A familiar face opened the door to my holding cell and removed my restraints, and after taking care of a couple of wizards that my rescuer hadn't fought yet, we found and freed Willow. Turned out, they hadn't actually hurt her beyond a couple of bruises. Guess that blood stain on my captor's jacket was faked. Also turned out, she didn't tell them any thing of importance. My little rookie did a fine job.
