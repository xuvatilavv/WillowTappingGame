# Willow Tapping

You are Adelaide Quelby, a highly experienced mercenary witch who is currently working for the Mages of Brittle Hollow, acting as an undercover agent in a rival organization called the Grim Sages. You are there alongside a rookie that your organization assigned to you (despite your protests), biding time until you can get your hands on the Ever-Stone Matrix and escape. Unfortunately, you were identified before you could get that far, and now sit in a holding cell, isolated from your rookie, and in order to have any chance of a rescue team come to save you and rookie Willow, you must be sure to tell the interrogator nothing of the truth - and hope that Willow does the same.


# Details

This game was originally made for [2022 Novice Summer Jam Series: One-Button Input Jam](https://itch.io/jam/nsjs-2022-jam-9)

Theme: One button input

Came across the jam about 20 hours before the deadline, so this is made in only that time period. 

The intention was to make a game based on [tap code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_code), a method for communicating with a single tone without speaking.

Unfortunately, due to time constraints, the actual tap code mechanic didn't get included >.> instead, during interrogations you tap to select from a list of options provided by the interrogator. Multiple endings are written, but not implemented. If you're curious, you can see them at the end of the [strings file](./text/strings.csv).


This project was made using [Godot 3.5](https://godotengine.org/).
